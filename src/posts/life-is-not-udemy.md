First of all this is my first attempt to write a blog. Probably there will be some English type mistakes and grammar mistakes, I apologize for that.

If I want to mention about myself; my name is Orhan and I’m living in Izmir, Turkey. I’m 23 and studying computer engineering at Eskişehir Osmangazi University.

Almost 8 months ago I started to learn web programming which I’ll cover my adventure in the future blogs. With this path I’ve learned several big things. Today I’ll mention about one of them.

If you’re interested in learning programming you probably heard Udemy before. Udemy is video tutorial platform includes lots of different topics and tutorials about them. I’ve learned tons of things from this site like millions of people. I strongly recommend it if you are interested in programming.

On the other hand there is some risky points with Udemy or with every tutorial series. One of them is actually about us I mean as human being we never feel ready when we are learning new things. At least I’m like that 🤠. I’m writing these things very confidently because It happened to me in very short past.

Let’s get back to subject, as I said when we want to learn something new this is really hard path for us. We don’t know where to start or we don’t know what is enough or what to learn next. At that point we are running to tutorials which is very good way to learn something. Because people who created this tutorials are experienced and knows what they are doing. I was thinking like that when I started to learn web programming. I bought one course about HTML and CSS, after that bought Javascript course and after that bought another CSS course and so on and so fourth.

After I watched tens of hours my HTML and CSS tutorials and did exactly what instructor told me to do I was extremely comfortable and felt so cool because it all happened in couple of weeks, impressive 🚀. I thought that I can make something own my own. I tried to remake Shazam webpage I couldn’t even centered navigation bar properly 🤦‍♂️. It was a huge failure for me. I barely remembered what to do.

As you can see it’s not very impressive web site but I spend quite a bit time for this one. I assure you I learned so much when I did this. The thing that I want to say here if you don’t try to do something by yourself you can not learn.

Of course tutorials teach you a lot but real life things are not the same you can not fully learn something until you realize you need it. That was first lesson for me.

After this experience I found a path for me. I think this is one of the best way to learn. Now first I’m not hurry to learn new things I’m practicing a lot, I make baby steps but I’m trying to learn what I’m doing. I’m taking advantage of tutorials but not living with them.

Long story short I recommend to new programmers you should definitely find your path and learn it with your favorite way if it’s watching tutorials you can watch or read a book or documentation but after that you really should try to do something by yourself.
